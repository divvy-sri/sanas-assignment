Make a PyTorch module which receives an input, the Module should do these things

1) Normalize the input along each column [Sum of squares of all elements in a column = 1]
2) Implement Linear Layer

Generate 10 random input samples and pass it through this Module, save the results.

Now, do the same implementation using C++ and assert the results from Pytorch and C++ to be close [or same]
